# Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech Assistant

This project is a simple Python script that utilizes speech recognition and text-to-speech synthesis to interact with users via voice. It listens for spoken input, processes it, and provides audio feedback.

## Features

- **Speech Recognition**: Converts spoken words into text using the `speech_recognition` library.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Converts text into speech using the `pyttsx3` library.
- **Interactive Conversations**: Responds to specific voice inputs like "hello."
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

1. **Python 3.6+**
2. **Required Libraries**:
   - `pyttsx3`: For text-to-speech conversion.
   - `speech_recognition`: For speech recognition.
   - `pyjokes` (Optional): For adding humor to your assistant in future updates.

Install the libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pyttsx3 speechrecognition pyjokes
